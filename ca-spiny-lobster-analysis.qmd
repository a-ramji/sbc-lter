## Introduction

In this Quarto Document, I'll be working with data from the Santa Barbara Coast LTER sites, analyzing data using statistical analysis methods covered in the Master of Environmental Data Science program's Environmental Data Science (EDS) 222: Statistics for Environmental Data Science course taught by Tamma Carleton (tcarleton\@ucsb.edu).

I first became interested in lobsters in 2021 during the pandemic, when I, and millions of other lobster laypeople came across a now [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@jacob__knowles?lang=en)- and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@jacobknowles5421)-famous Maine Lobster fisherman's videos. In these clips, Jacob Knowles, the current lead of a multi-generational, family-owned lobster fishing operation, candidly portrays what it's like to be a lobster fisherman in Maine during lobster season. This is a gross generalization, and there are many nuances, including casually disseminated lobster facts and information, special close-ups on rare lobsters (sometimes blue, recently a 1-in-50 Million chance \[half-blue-half-red\](<https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/lobster-half-blue-maine-tiktok-bowie-b2450916.html>) lobster named Bowie.

I later learned that Maine Lobster fisheries are threatened by climate change, with rising sea temperatures and environmental pressures pushing American Lobster (*Homarus americanus*) populations farther north or into general decline if not managed appropriately (Stancioff, 2016, Greenhalgh, 2016, Rheuban et. al., 2017). Intense warming in waters on the East Coast coupled with failure to act and adapt quickly enough has already led to the collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery (Pershing et. al., 2015).

Lobsters are sensitive to change, and it can impact their behavior (Quin, Rochette, 2015). Recent studies suggests that changing sea temperatures have implications on the size at which *Homarus americanus* reach maturity, and bacterial diversity and cultivability (Ellertson et. al., 2022, Ishaq et. al., 2023). Warming that impacts areas that juvenile lobsters rely on can lead them to become inhospitable, which is particularly dangerous as the Gulf of Maine has been warming at a rate faster than 99% of the world's oceans (Rheuban et. al., 2017, Gulf of Maine Research Institute, 2021).

**Given all of this established background and concern over the American Lobsters, as a Santa Barbara resident and lifelong fan of the California coast and all of its marine life, I wondered if the California Spiny Lobster *Panulirus interruptus,* was facing similar threats.**

The species is currently listed as a species of "least concern" on the IUCN Redlist, and their populations have been managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for decades. If you aren't already convinced, I'm happy to inform you that the CA Spiny Lobster is significant both economically and ecologically. In the 2017-2018 fishing season, the commercial fishery accounted for roughly \$12.7 million in ex-vessel value, and the recreational fishery contributes "between \$33-40 million in consumer spending to the California economy each year," (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2019).

Do you think kelp forests are cool? Well, these lobsters are also a keystone species in California's kelp forest ecosystems. They're a key predator of purple sea urchins, which love to eat the kelp that the rest of the ecosystem depends on. Spiny lobsters relieve this predation (urchin grazing) on Giant Kelp forests and as many larger fish prey on these lobsters, they are a key, mid-trophic level species (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2019). They typically forage at night, and according to the CADFW's Marine Species Portal, "Spiny lobster provides an important role in the ecology of rocky reefs, and it is associated with critical habitats such as surfgrass beds," (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2019).

The Santa Barbara Coast and the Channel Islands National Park are key areas of the Spiny lobsters' habitat:

![](figs/ca-spiny-lobster-habitat.jpg){width="538"}

The presence of eelgrass or surfgrass in the rocky reefs in these areas provide critical habitat for the 11 larval stages of Spiny lobsters.

The Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research project (SBC LTER) has many study sites at which a wide variety of data are collected, from fish abundance and population dynamics to complex water chemistry and temperature data. Using this data and the context given above, I tried to answer the question: **What is the relationship between California Spiny Lobster populations and Reef bottom temperatures?**

To answer this, I used Carapace Length as it is the primary size metric for lobsters and is used as a proxy measurement for age. I also used reef bottom temperatures (as apposed to sea surface temperatures (SST). All of this data was collected at reef study sites in the SBC LTER network.

### SBC LTER long term kelp forest study sites

The five SBC LTER Reef sites that I'll be using data from in this analysis are:

-   Arroyo Quemado Reef: site code "AQUE"

    -   Arroyo Quemado Reef depth range from 5.4 m to 10.7 m. Reference on Land is close to US101/Arroyo Quemada Ln.

-   Naples Reef: site code "NAPL"

    -   Naples Reef is located on the Santa Barbara Channel near the community of Naples and Dos Pueblos Canyon, Santa Barbara County, CA. Depth ranges from -5.9 to -13.4 meters.

-   Isla Vista Reef: site code "IVEE":

    -   Isla Vista (IV) Reef is located on the Santa Barbara Channel near the University of California Santa Barbara, CA. Depth range is from -8.2 to -8.8 meters.

-   Mohawk Reef: site code "MOHK":

    -   Mohawk Reef: Mohawk Reef depth ranges from 4.5m to 6.0 m. Reference on land is Mohawk Rd / Edgewater Way.

-   Carpinteria Reef: site code "CARP":

    -   Carpinteria Reef is located on the Santa Barbara Channel offshore of the Carpinteria Salt Marsh. Depth range is from -2.2 to -8.8 meters

I've labeled these on a screenshot of a geographically contextual rendered map preview from the SBC LTER site:

## About the Data

### Dataset 1: SBC LTER: Reef: California Spiny Lobster Data

This dataset contains records on the abundance, size, and fishing effort on the California Spiny Lobster, *Panulirus interruptus*, at five SBC LTER study sites, with records from August 2012 to August 2023.

While most data was collected in the month of August at the selected study sites, there is a discrepancy that is very relevant to our analysis. - In 2014, the Arroyo Quemado Reef (site code AQUE) only had data collected in September (56 observations), and the Isla Vista Reef site (site code IVEE) had 6 carapace length observations collected in September and 114 in August of that same year.

This is relevant to our analysis because both carapace length and ocean temperatures are related to the time of year -- as more time passes, lobsters grow in size, and water temperatures fluctuate seasonally, as shown in this data visualization of monthly mean temperatures from Shore Stations (one of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography's programs that works to collect daily temperature (SST) and salinity records at sites along the California coast from La Jolla to Trinidad)

[![5 year monthly mean SSTs vs long-term averages](figs/shore-stations-monthly-mean-temp.png){fig-alt="The figure above shows the monthly temperature means calculated from the past 5 years (2018-2022) at all stations, shown in the solid lines, where each station is a unique color (see legend for details). This plot also shows the long-term average from every station, beginning from whatever time the station started collecting data (for details, see section above titled \"General Information\"). The long term averages are shown as dashed lines, where color is coordinated for each station. Notably, temperatures peak around August each year."}](https://shorestations.ucsd.edu/)

Notes on methods, limitations: - transects were sampled by two SCUBA divers during daylight hours -- this is notable because lobsters are most active at night, which may add further limitations on the ability of the sample of the population, so any conclusions we come to based on our analysis of these data may not have as much significance or strength in our ability to make claims about the true population.

### Dataset 2: SBC LTER: Reef: Bottom temperature data

This dataset contains records of the water temperature at the bottom (or a relatively low, non-surface depth) at nine of the SBC LTER Reef study sites in 15 minute intervals beginning in 2000 up to July 4th, 2023. I accessed this continuous water temperature dataset via the [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.13.29). The primary data file on this portal is a .csv, which is 372.8 MB. The key variables that I'll be using in this data set are:

-   **Site_code** (default column name: SITE), which contains a string of the name of the field site that each measurement was taken at. Note that the depth of temperature logger at each site varies from 4.95 to 8.15 meters.

-   **date** (default column name: DATE_LOCAL), which contains the date of observation in the format YYYY-MM-DD

-   **Temperature in Celsius** (default column name: TEMP_C): Ambient water temperature, measured with Onset tidbit. "tidbit" refers to the measurement instrument, a 32K StowAway TidbiT (-5 deg C to 37 deg C) manufactured by Onset Computer Corporation.

The NA code for this dataset is -99999.

head(water_data, 2) %>% gt()

```

### Preliminary plotting, data exploration

Let's check our data for normality to see what our options are in terms of analysis:

```{r lobster-size-dist}
# check to see if normally distributed

mean_size <- mean(lobster_size$size_mm)
sd_size <- sd(lobster_size$size_mm)

lobster_size_dist <- ggplot(data = lobster_size) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = size_mm),
                 fill = "seagreen",
                 color = "black",
                 bins = 45) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_size,
             linetype = "dashed",
             color = "skyblue",
             linewidth = 0.8,
             size = 0.6) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_size + (2 * sd_size),
             linetype = "dotted",
             size = 0.6) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_size - (2 * sd_size),
             linetype = "dotted",
             size = 0.6) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of California Spiny Lobster Size", 
       subtitle = "SBC LTER CA data (2012-2023), size measured by carapace length (mm)",
       x = "Carapace Length (mm)",
       y = "Count")


lobster_size_dist

```

The data appears relatively normally distributed, with a clear aggregation of the data around the mean (light blue, dashed line) and the bulk of the data within two standard deviations away from the mean (black dotted lines). There is also a right tail indicating several counts of higher values.

```{r temp-dist}
# check to see if normally distributed
mean_temp <- mean(water_data$temp_c)
sd_temp <- sd(water_data$temp_c)

temp_dist <- ggplot(data = water_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = temp_c),
                 fill = "cornflowerblue",
                 color = "black",
                 bins = 45) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_temp,
             linetype = "dashed",
             linewidth = 1,
             color = "darkturquoise",
             size = 0.7) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_temp + (2 * sd_temp),
             linetype = "dotted",
             size = 0.6) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_temp - (2 * sd_temp),
             linetype = "dotted",
             size = 0.6) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Reef bottom temperatures (ºC) (2002-2023)", 
       subtitle = "at nine SBC LTER Reef sites ",
       x = "Temperature (ºC)",
       y = "Count")


temp_dist


```

The data appears relatively normally distributed, with a clear aggregation to the slight left of the mean (blue dashed line) the bulk of the data falling within 2 standard deviations away from the mean (dotted black lines) . There is also a right tail and right skew.

To know what we should do with our "outlier" September data records, let's see the number of data points that were collected in September at the two sites we know they were collected at.

```{r sept-data}

sept_data <- lobster_size %>% 
  filter(month == 9) 

# we can also see that the only year that size data was collected in was 2014
#print(unique(sept_data$year))
print(unique(sept_data$site))


# finding proportion of IVEE data collected in September, 2014
iv_2014 <- lobster_size %>% 
  filter(site == "IVEE",
         year == 2014) 

iv_sept <- iv_2014 %>% filter(month == 9) 
iv_sept_pct <- nrow(iv_sept) / nrow(iv_2014) * 100


# we can also see that all of site AQUE's data in 2014 was collected in September:
aq_2014 <- lobster_size %>% 
  filter(site == "AQUE",
         year == 2014)

aq_sept <- aq_2014 %>% filter(month == 9) 
aq_sept_pct <- nrow(aq_sept) / nrow(aq_2014) * 100


print(paste0("The September data records account for ", round(iv_sept_pct, 2), "% of IVEE Reef's 2014 data points"))
print(paste0("The September data records account for ", round(aq_sept_pct, 3), "% of AQUE Reef's 2014 data points"))

```

**Preliminary exploration** shows us that the primary month that data was collected in is August (`month == 8`), with the exception of AQUE and IVEE study sites in 2014, where data was collected in September (site `IVEE` (around 5% of the site's 2014 observations) and `AQUE` (100% of the site's 2014 observations)).

As 2015 is an important year for our study (El Niño), it is important to have a baseline of lobster carapace size from the year before. Because this data collection began in 2012, leaving out the 2014 September data for the AQUE site would mean only have 2 years of precedent before the El Niño event. Having only

Due to the nature of lobster carapace size increasing over time (positive age-size relationship), if we include the 2014 September data for AQUE, we could get a falsely high "baseline" carapace size for that study site before the El Niño event, which could skew our results. An additional concern I have is about how our average Reef bottom temperature data will interact in all of this. Sea surface temperatures fluctuate over time and both seasonal variation and wind levels can impact ocean temperatures on the California Coast (Mendessohn et. al., 2004, Castelao and Wang, 2014).

Another issue that comes up with excluding 2014 data for the AQUE study site is that in all other sites, the avereage carapace size (mm) was greater in 2014 than in 2013. This could mean that by excluding 2014 data for the AQUE study site, in our attempt to avoid a falsely high baseline/comparison point, we are obtaining a falsely low one. If we include both months of 2014 data, the IVEE study site is also skewed to have higher average carapace sizes for that year, as I'll show later.

We have a few options here. We could either limit our dataset to just August (`month == 8`) to get a more even and fairly comparable set of averages across sites in our data, or include the September data and continue on with our analysis, keeping this discrepancy in mind. Another option is to make two subsets, one of just August data, and another of all of our data, and run our regression and analyses on both separately. We could also make an estimate of what we'd expect the average carapace length to be in August, 2014 for site AQUE and not include the September data for AQUE or IVEE. Another option would be to omit site AQUE from our analysis, and exclude the September data from site IVEE.

Thus, in this analysis, I will make two subsets: one in which we keep all of our data (denoted in our outputs as August data and August & September data), and the other will only include data collected in August. We can compare the results of our statistical analyses as we go.

## Averages

### Making subsets, taking ~~names~~ means

First, we'll make two subsets (August vs. August & September) and then we'll plot the average carapace lengths over time, grouped by site,

```{r lobster-subsets}
# making a tidied subset, finding average count and size per year per site

# keeping data from August and September
lobster_all <- lobster_size %>% 
  group_by(year, month, site) %>% 
  summarize(avg_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_size = max(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            min_size = min(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

# keeping August data only
lobster_august <- lobster_size %>%  
  filter(month(date) == 8) %>% 
  group_by(year, site) %>% 
  summarize(avg_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_size = max(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            min_size = min(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- The vertical dotted line indicates the first year of the 2015-2016 El Niño

- The lower dashed horizontal line indicates the average estimated size (and corresponding age) at which the California Spiny Lobster reaches sexual maturity: around 2.5 inches (63.5 mm), or 58mm and 5 years old for Males and 70 mm and roughly 7 years old for Females (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2019), (Lindberg 1955, in Engle 1979).

- The higher dashed horizontal line indicates the minimum legal catch size: a carapace measuring 3.25 inches or 82.55 mm, or around 8-13 years old (estimated age range of 7-11 for Males, 8-13 for Females) (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2019).

#### Interpretation

-   Note the significant difference in slopes between year 2014 and 2015 data points for average carapace size (mm) at the AQUE study site between the September-inclusive and September-exclusive (August only) plots. There is also a subtle change at the IVEE study site between 2014 and 2015 between the two plots as well, supporting what we know about how carapace lengths increase over time, even on a monthly level.  


Taking the average size (carpace length) per site per year showed potentially interesting trends. At all sites, there is a notable drop in average carapace length (mm) from 2014 to 2015, both including and excluding September 2014 data. This significant change in slope of the lines connecting data points for average carapace length coincides with the 2015/2016 El Niño, which was the strongest over a 145 year record (Barnard et. al., 2017). During El Niño events, sea surface temperatures (SST) rise, and SST estimates can also serve as an indicator for coastal ocean temperature levels -- if SST is rising, the temperatures at the bottom of relatively shallow, coastal reef sites are likely rising as well. In some cases, depending on the thermocline (inverted or not) that a reef experiences, Sea Bottom Temperatures (SBT) can even be higher than SST (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission).


These visualizations suggests that the Santa Barbara Coast LTER sites are somewhat of a haven for California Spiny lobsters in their first few of years of breeding, as stated on the CADFW info page on the California Spiny lobster. As this graph shows an *average* carapace size, and lobsters can vary significantly in size depending on their age, these research sites are likely home to a wide age and developmental stage range of lobsters.


Let's move on to incorporate the other essential data in investigating the relationship between reef bottom temperatures and average lobster size (carapace length, mm), -- Reef bottom temperature!



### Average reef bottom temperature over time

Our reef bottom temperature data is pretty huge -- temperatures were recorded every 15 minutes at multiple SBC LTER study sites since 2002.

Regarding our previous dilemma of "to include or not to include" September carapace length data, we now have an opportunity to decide how we want to aggregate our reef bottom temperature data. I could filter it by month, keeping temperature records only from the month of August, or I could include September as well. I could also have another different subset, which incorporates temperature data from August and September only at sites IVEE and AQUE for 2014, and filter it to only keep August dates for all other sites that year and all sites at all years. This can get pretty complicated pretty quickly, as the easiest inclusive option -- filtering just for August and September -- has the drawback of interfering with the estimated relationship between average carapace length and water temperature for the majority of our data.

In my analysis, I've decided to only select reef bottom temperature records in the month of August, which I then average and join with the lobster data by year and by site. 

First, we'll plot the average August reef bottom temperature per year across all sites, noting the spike in temperature in the first year of the 2015/2016 El Niño. This dataset ranges from 2002 to 2023, but the last month of the record is July, so we'll have August data spanning from 2002-2023 before we join it with our lobster data set. Then, we'll plot the average August temperatures over time by site, comparing with the average size by site plot created earlier.

```{r water-avg plot}

# prepping water temp data to compare with lobster data

# finding average August reef bottom temperatures across all sites over 
# the full time range of our water dataset (2002-2022)
allsites_aug_temps <- water_data %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(8)) |> # select August temps
  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %>% # selecting Lobster data study sites
  group_by(year) %>%  
  summarize(avg_temp = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE)) # find avg temp


site_temps <- water_data %>%  
  filter(month(date) %in% c(8, 9)) %>%  # select August temps
#  filter(year > 2011) |>  # selecting lobster data time range
  # I took out this step because it made the plot axes contain 0.0, 0.5 numeric values
  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %>%   # selecting Lobster data study sites
  group_by(year, month, site) %>%  
  summarize(avg_temp = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE)) # find avg temp


august_temps <- water_data %>%
  filter(site %in% c((unique(lobster_size$site)))) %>% 
  filter(month == 8)

mean_aug_temp <- mean(august_temps$temp_c)

print(paste0("The average August reef bottom temperature across the 5 reef study sites from 2002-2022 is ", round(mean_aug_temp, 2), "ºC."))
```


```{r water-temp-plot}
# making a subset to show selected year range
allsites_aug_temp_plot <- ggplot(data = allsites_aug_temps) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, 
                 y = avg_temp)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, 
                y = avg_temp)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2015,  linetype = "dotted") + # showing 2015 El Niño 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = (seq(2000,2022, by = 5)), 
                     minor_breaks = seq(2002, 2022, by = 1)) +

  annotate("text", x=2014, y=19, label="El Niño", angle=0)

```

There is a clear spike in average reef bottom temperature in August of 2015 across all study sites, and a significant dip in 2010. There is also a notable spike (and maximum peak) at all sites in 2018. There were record-breaking SST anomalies in 2018 at many points along the Southern California Coastline, particularly along La Jolla, San Diego, where the Scripps Institution of Oceanography recorded water temperatures of 25.9 degrees Celsius, beating the previous record of 25.8 C from 1931 (NASA Earth Observatory, 2018, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 2018).


Now we'll join the lobster size data and the temperature data, which will narrow our time range to 2012-2022.

```{r lobster-temp-joins}
lobster_temps_august <- inner_join(lobster_august, site_temps) %>% 
  select(-max_size, -min_size)

# this will make sure that we're comparing the same month for each site and each year, 
# so for most years, sites, and months, it'll be august data
# but for the 2014 AQUE and IVEE data collected in September,
# we'll be pairing those averages with average temperature in September
lobster_temps_all <- inner_join(lobster_all, site_temps) %>% 
  select(-max_size, -min_size)

```

*The dotted vertical line in each graph once again shows the beginning of the 2015/2016 El Niño. The dashed horizontal lines in the temperature plots show the 20-year average August reef bottom temperature (from 2002-2022). The dashed horizontal lines in the average size plot show the carapace lengths at sexual maturity (lower) and catch size (higher).*



Comparing our average temperature and average size plots side by side, there seems to be visual evidence for some trends or relationship between average temperature and average carapace length. At all sites, in 2015 when the average August temperature spikes, average carapace lengths decrease. At the Naples reef site, after the temperature spikes in 2018 and falls dramatically in 2019, we see a spike in average carapace length in 2019. As average August reef bottom temperatures continue to fall in 2020 in Naples, lower than the average temperature over the previous 8 years, the avereage carapace size seems to drop slightly at that site. The most extreme drops in average carapace length at sites Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, and Mohawk happen when the temperature spikes in 2015. When temperatures fall back down closer to the 20-year average August reef bottom temperature in 2016, the Arroyo Quemado reef site is the only site where average carapace lengths seem to recover within that annual cycle. Unfortunately, we are missing temperature data at the Mohawk reef site in 2017. Overall, there seem to be complexities in the population structures at all sites, with similar overall trends in average August reef bottom temperature.



## Lobster size & reef temperature relationship

With our current data, we can model the relationship between average carapace length (mm) in August with the following equation:

$$\mu CL_i =\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} \mu Temp_i +\beta_{2} \text Site+\varepsilon_i$$
Where

- $\mu CL$ is the average carapace length, in millimeters, in August
- $\beta_{0}$ is the intercept, or expected average carapace length, in millimeters, when the average August temperature is 0ºC and site is held constant (for our reference site, AQUE)
- $\beta_{1}$ is the slope or expected change in average carapace length given a 1 unit change in average temperature (1ºC), when site is held constant (for our reference site, AQUE)
- $\beta_{2}$ is the difference in slope or expected change in average carapace length given a 1 unit change in average temperature (1ºC) between our reference group (site AQUE) and each other site.
- $\varepsilon$ is our error term, containing everything else that impacts average expected carapace length as measured in August.

Once again, whenever I say "average", followed by any term, I'm referring to the average of that variable *as measured in August* of each year. 


We can run this linear regression feeding "site" into the equation, with data across all 5 sites, and we can also run our linear regression model on each site, which would shift our equation to a simple linear regression of 

$$\mu CL_i =\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} \mu Temp_i +\varepsilon_i$$

where the main change is that our $\beta_{1}$ term is now the expected change in average carapace length given a 1 unit or 1ºC change in average temperature.



First, let's plot our general, overall relationship between average carapace length and average reef bottom temperature in August, using only data from August.

### Plotting 


```{r lobster-temp-rel-plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}


# preliminary plot of the joined data
lobster_temps_august_plot <- ggplot(data = lobster_temps_august, 
                             aes(x = avg_temp,
                                 y = avg_size)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm',
              formula= y~x,
              na.rm = TRUE,
              color="seagreen",
              se=TRUE) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(14.5, 20)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(65, 94)) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Average Lobster Size by Average Reef Bottom Temperature (August, annual averages)", 
       subtitle = "SBC LTER data on California Spiny Lobster carapace length (mm), reef bottom temperatures (ºC)", 
       x = "Average Temperature (ºC)",
       y = "Average Size (mm)")

```


There seems to be a relationship here, where as average reef bottom temperatures increase, average lobster carapace lengths decrease, though with relatively few data points here and the impact that site may have on this relationship not accounted for in this plot, it's hard to make any real claims.


Multiple Regression: $$\mu CL_i =\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} \mu Temp_i +\beta_{2} \text Site+\varepsilon_i$$

```{r lobster-temps-simple-lm}
# run simple linear regression on temp and size, taking temperature differences at each site into account

# for august-only data
lobster_temp_reg_august <- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp + site, data = lobster_temps_august)
#summary(lobster_temp_reg_august)


# for september-inclusive lobster data and august-only water temp data
lobster_temp_reg <- lm(formula = avg_size ~ avg_temp + site, data = lobster_temps_all)
#summary(lobster_temp_reg)


# use sjPlot to show a comparison of the outputs from running these models


sjPlot::tab_model(lobster_temp_reg_august, lobster_temp_reg,
                  #  title = "Multiple Regression: formula = average  ~ avg_temp + site",
                  dv.labels = c("August", "August & September"),
                  digits = 3
)



```

### Regression Interpretation

Interpretation of coefficients in September-inclusive Regression:

-   **Intercept:** at the Arroyo Quemado Reef (AQUE) study site (our "dummy variable"), when the reef bottom temperature is 0 degrees Celsius, the expected lobster carapace size is 94.1 mm (nonsensical, from the SBC LTER records of reef bottom temperatures, which have been recorded every 15 minutes, ongoing since 2002, the minimum recorded temperature of all time in our data set is `r(min(water_temp$temp_c))` degrees Celsius).
-   **Slope: `avg_temp`:** Holding `site` constant (comparing average lobster carapace lengths and average water temperatures only to those of the same SBC LTER study site), at the AQUE study site, given a one unit change in average reef bottom temperature (an increase of 1 degree Celsius), we expect the average carapace length of lobsters to change by `r cat(round(lobster_temp_reg$coefficients['avg_temp'], 2))` mm.

Interpretation of `site` coefficients: - Note, the coefficients following `avg_temp` are to be interpreted in relation to `avg_temp`, as it represents AQUE, our test or dummy variable.

-   `siteCARP`: For the SBC LTER Carpenteria Reef study site, given a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, we expect to see a `r cat(round(lobster_temp_reg$coefficients['siteCARP'], 2))` mm increase in average lobster carapace size as compared to the AQUE site expected slope of -1.14 mm per 1 degree increase in Celsius, for a total expected change in average lobster carapace length of `r cat(round(lobster_temp_reg$coefficients['siteCARP'] + lobster_temp_reg$coefficients['avg_temp'], 2))` mm.

(moving forward, I will only describe the overall/total expected change (`site___` + `avg_temp`)):

-   `siteIVEE`: For the SBC LTER Isla Vista Reef study site, given a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, we expect to see a 0.04 mm *increase* in average lobster carapace size.
-   `siteMOHK`: For the SBC LTER Mohawk Reef study site, given a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, we expect to see a 2.48 mm *decrease* in average lobster carapace size.
-   `siteNAPL`: For the SBC LTER Naples Reef study site, given a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, we expect to see a 6.61 mm *increase* in average lobster carapace size.

**Interpreting Uncertainty:** - There is notably more uncertainty in the September-inclusive regression than in the regression run on data collected exclusively in August, with the exception of slightly smaller Standard Errors in the August-exclusive regression.

-   The intercept estimate is a fatalistically significant estimate, with a significance level of 0 being met in both regressions.

-   In both regression summaries, we can see that the significance levels of 0.1 (no symbol) and 0.01 ('\*' symbol) are not met for the rest of the coefficients if we round to the nearest relevant decimal place. If we do not round, then
