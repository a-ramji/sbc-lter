## Introduction

In this Quarto Document, I'll be working with data from the Santa Barbara Coast LTER sites, analyzing data using statistical analysis methods covered in the Master of Environmental Data Science program's Environmental Data Science (EDS) 222: Statistics for Environmental Data Science course taught by Tamma Carleton (tcarleton\@ucsb.edu).

I first became interested in lobsters in 2021 during the pandemic, when I, and millions of other lobster laypeople came across a now [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@jacob__knowles?lang=en)- and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@jacobknowles5421)-famous Maine Lobster fisherman's videos. In these clips, Jacob Knowles, the current lead of a multi-generational, family-owned lobster fishing operation, candidly portrays what it's like to be a lobster fisherman in Maine during lobster season. This is a gross generalization, and there are many nuances, including casually disseminated lobster facts and information, special close-ups on rare lobsters (sometimes blue, recently a 1-in-50 Million chance \[half-blue-half-red\](<https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/lobster-half-blue-maine-tiktok-bowie-b2450916.html>) lobster named Bowie.

I later learned that Maine Lobster fisheries are threatened by climate change, with rising sea temperatures and environmental pressures pushing American Lobster (*Homarus americanus*) populations farther north or into general decline if not managed appropriately (Stancioff, 2016, Greenhalgh, 2016, Rheuban et. al., 2017). Intense warming in waters on the East Coast coupled with failure to act and adapt quickly enough has already led to the collapse of the Gulf of Maine cod fishery (Pershing et. al., 2015).

Lobsters are sensitive to change, and it can impact their behavior (Quin, Rochette, 2015). Recent studies suggests that changing sea temperatures have implications on the size at which *Homarus americanus* reach maturity, and bacterial diversity and cultivability (Ellertson et. al., 2022, Ishaq et. al., 2023). Warming that impacts areas that juvenile lobsters rely on can lead them to become inhospitable, which is particularly dangerous as the Gulf of Maine has been warming at a rate faster than 99% of the world's oceans (Rheuban et. al., 2017, Gulf of Maine Research Institute, 2021).

**Given all of this established background and concern over the American Lobsters, as a Santa Barbara resident and lifelong fan of the California coast and all of its marine life, I wondered if the California Spiny Lobster *Panulirus interruptus,* was facing similar threats.**

The species is currently listed as a species of "least concern" on the IUCN Redlist, and their populations have been managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for decades. If you aren't already convinced, I'm happy to inform you that the CA Spiny Lobster is significant both economically and ecologically. In the 2017-2018 fishing season, the commercial fishery accounted for roughly \$12.7 million in ex-vessel value, and the recreational fishery contributes "between \$33-40 million in consumer spending to the California economy each year," (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2019).

Do you think kelp forests are cool? Well, these lobsters are also a keystone species in California's kelp forest ecosystems. They're a key predator of purple sea urchins, which love to eat the kelp that the rest of the ecosystem depends on. Spiny lobsters relieve this predation (urchin grazing) on Giant Kelp forests and as many larger fish prey on these lobsters, they are a key, mid-trophic level species (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2019). They typically forage at night, and according to the CADFW's Marine Species Portal, "Spiny lobster provides an important role in the ecology of rocky reefs, and it is associated with critical habitats such as surfgrass beds," (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2019).

The Santa Barbara Coast and the Channel Islands National Park are key areas of the Spiny lobsters' habitat:

The presence of eelgrass or surfgrass in the rocky reefs in these areas provide critical habitat for the 11 larval stages of Spiny lobsters.

The Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research project (SBC LTER) has many study sites at which a wide variety of data are collected, from fish abundance and population dynamics to complex water chemistry and temperature data. Using this data and the context given above, I tried to answer the question: **What is the relationship between California Spiny Lobster populations and Reef bottom temperatures?**

To answer this, I used Carapace Length as it is the primary size metric for lobsters and is used as a proxy measurement for age. I also used reef bottom temperatures (as apposed to sea surface temperatures (SST). All of this data was collected at reef study sites in the SBC LTER network.

-   Spiny lobsters mature at about 5 years of age, or 2.5-inch carapace length. They have a complex, 2-year reproductive cycle from mating to the settlement of juvenile lobsters. Fecundity increases with size, and females produce one brood of eggs per year.
-   2.5 inches = 63.5 mm

### SBC LTER long term kelp forest study sites

The five SBC LTER Reef sites that I'll be using data from in this analysis are:

-   Arroyo Quemado Reef: site code "AQUE"

    -   Arroyo Quemado Reef depth range from 5.4 m to 10.7 m. Reference on Land is close to US101/Arroyo Quemada Ln.

-   Naples Reef: site code "NAPL"

    -   Naples Reef is located on the Santa Barbara Channel near the community of Naples and Dos Pueblos Canyon, Santa Barbara County, CA. Depth ranges from -5.9 to -13.4 meters.

-   Isla Vista Reef: site code "IVEE":

    -   Isla Vista (IV) Reef is located on the Santa Barbara Channel near the University of California Santa Barbara, CA. Depth range is from -8.2 to -8.8 meters.

-   Mohawk Reef: site code "MOHK":

    -   Mohawk Reef: Mohawk Reef depth ranges from 4.5m to 6.0 m. Reference on land is Mohawk Rd / Edgewater Way.

-   Carpinteria Reef: site code "CARP":

    -   Carpinteria Reef is located on the Santa Barbara Channel offshore of the Carpinteria Salt Marsh. Depth range is from -2.2 to -8.8 meters

I've labeled these on a screenshot of a geographically contextual rendered map preview from the SBC LTER site:

## About the Data

### Dataset 1: SBC LTER: Reef: California Spiny Lobster Data

This dataset contains records on the abundance, size, and fishing effort on the California Spiny Lobster, *Panulirus interruptus*, at five SBC LTER study sites, with records from August 2012 to August 2023.

While most data was collected in the month of August at the selected study sites, there is a discrepancy that is very relevant to our analysis. - In 2014, the Arroyo Quemado Reef (site code AQUE) only had data collected in September (56 observations), and the Isla Vista Reef site (site code IVEE) had 6 carapace length observations collected in September and 114 in August of that same year.

This is relevant to our analysis because both carapace length and ocean temperatures are related to the time of year -- as more time passes, lobsters grow in size, and water temperatures fluctuate seasonally, as shown in this data visualization of monthly mean temperatures from Shore Stations (one of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography's programs that works to collect daily temperature (SST) and salinity records at sites along the California coast from La Jolla to Trinidad)

[![5 year monthly mean SSTs vs long-term averages](figs/shore-stations-monthly-mean-temp.png){fig-alt="The figure above shows the monthly temperature means calculated from the past 5 years (2018-2022) at all stations, shown in the solid lines, where each station is a unique color (see legend for details). This plot also shows the long-term average from every station, beginning from whatever time the station started collecting data (for details, see section above titled \"General Information\"). The long term averages are shown as dashed lines, where color is coordinated for each station. Notably, temperatures peak around August each year."}](https://shorestations.ucsd.edu/)

Notes on methods, limitations: - transects were sampled by two SCUBA divers during daylight hours -- this is notable because lobsters are most active at night, which may add further limitations on the ability of the sample of the population, so any conclusions we come to based on our analysis of these data may not have as much significance or strength in our ability to make claims about the true population.

### Dataset 2: SBC LTER: Reef: Bottom temperature data

This dataset contains records of the water temperature at the bottom (or a relatively low, non-surface depth) at nine of the SBC LTER Reef study sites in 15 minute intervals beginning in 2000 up to July 4th, 2023. I accessed this continuous water temperature dataset via the [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.13.29). The primary data file on this portal is a .csv, which is 372.8 MB. The key variables that I'll be using in this data set are:

-   **Site_code** (default column name: SITE), which contains a string of the name of the field site that each measurement was taken at. Note that the depth of temperature logger at each site varies from 4.95 to 8.15 meters.

-   **date** (default column name: DATE_LOCAL), which contains the date of observation in the format YYYY-MM-DD

-   **Temperature in Celsius** (default column name: TEMP_C): Ambient water temperature, measured with Onset tidbit. "tidbit" refers to the measurement instrument, a 32K StowAway TidbiT (-5 deg C to 37 deg C) manufactured by Onset Computer Corporation.

The NA code for this dataset is -99999.

## Reading in the Data

Lobster Data:

```{r lobster-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# read in lobster abundances & size data from EDI portal link
lobster_data <- read_csv("https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/dataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.9&entityid=f32823fba432f58f66c06b589b7efac6",
                         na = c("-99999")) # specifying NA value labels


lobster_size <- lobster_data %>% 
  clean_names() %>%  #  lower_snake_case column names
  # this dataset also has abundance, along with other information that we won't be using in our analysis. let's select what we're interested in:
  select(year, month, date, site, size_mm) %>% 
  # filtering out NA values for size_mm 
  drop_na(size_mm)
  
head(lobster_size, 3)

```

Note that the `year` and `month` columns are dtype <dbl> (double), rather than dates

```{r}

iv_2014 <- lobster_size %>% 
  filter(site == "IVEE") %>% 
  filter(year == 2014)

nrow(iv_2014)

```

Reef bottom temperature data:

```{r water-temp-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# this is a large file (372.8 MiB), so don't be alarmed if this step takes a while
water_data <- read_csv("https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/dataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.13.29&entityid=d707a45a2cd6eee1d016d99844d537da")



water_temp <- water_data %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename("date" = date_local, "time" = time_local) |> # cleaning names
  select(-serial, -time) %>% 
  mutate("year" = lubridate::year(date), # adding columns to join by
         "month" = lubridate::month(date)  # and filter later on
         ) 

head(water_temp)
```

### Preliminary plotting, data exploration

Let's check our data for normality to see what our options are in terms of analysis:

```{r lobster-size-dist}
# check to see if normally distributed

lobster_size_dist <- ggplot(data = lobster_abd) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = size_mm), fill = "seagreen", color = "black") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of California Spiny Lobster Size", 
       subtitle = "SBC LTER CA data (2012-2023), size measured by carapace length (mm)",
       x = "Carapace Length (mm)",
       y = "Count")


lobster_size_dist

```

This seems relatively normally distributed, with a right tail indicating several counts of higher values.
